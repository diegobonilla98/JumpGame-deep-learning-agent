# JumpGame-deep-learning-agent
Simple made JumpGame to taught an AI to play it. Using TensorFlow.js

The game uses simple deep reinforcement learning being the agent (human) score the point to improve. For each epoch, the agent with more score will be more likely to be chosen for the next one.

Visible issues:
-Not disposing the useless TensorFlow models from epoch to epoch.

The code is free to use and can be improved in a lot of ways.
